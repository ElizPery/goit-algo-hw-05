There was compared three types of searching: Rabin Karp search, Boyer Moore search and Kmp search. In the result, experiment with the first type of data and when searched substring exists show that the slowest was Rabin Karp search, while the fastest was Kmp search. Then, experiment with the first type of data and when searched substring doesn't exist show that the slowest was Rabin Karp search, while the fastest was Boyer Moore. 
Moreover, experiment with the second type of data and when searched substring exists show that the slowest was Boyer Moore search, while the fastest was Kmp search. Finally, experiment with the second type of data and when searched substring doesn't exist show that the slowest was Rabin Karp search, while the fastest was Boyer Moore. 
So, it can be concluded that the fastest search algorithm when searched substring exists is Kmp search, while the fastest search algorithm when searched substring doesn't exist is Boyer Moore search.
