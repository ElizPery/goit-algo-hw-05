There was compared three types of sorting: insertion sort, merge sort and sort function in Python. In the result, both experiments on small and large data show that the slowest was insertion sort, while the fastest was builded function in Python "sort". It can be because of usage possitive aspects of both insertion sort and merge sort in timsort method. That's why more efficient way to sort data is usage of "sort" function.
